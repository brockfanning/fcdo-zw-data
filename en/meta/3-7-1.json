Access to and use of an effective means to prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Proportion of demand satisfied by modern methods = Current contraceptive use, any modern method divided by (Unmet need + current contraceptive use, any method) </p>","DATA_VALIDATION":"<p>CSPro was used for data editing, weighting, cleaning, and tabulation.
